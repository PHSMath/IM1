\section{Solving Equations with Distribution - One Side}
The next type of equations we need to be able to solve are those in the form \sethlcolor{pink}\hl{$A(Bx\pm C)=D$}\sethlcolor{yellow} where $\{A,B,C,D \in \mathbb{R}; A \textrm{ and } B\neq 0\}$. There are two different methods to solve equations of this type, and the work is different for each method.
\subsection{How to ...}
The first method uses distribution. You multiply each term inside the parenthesis by the number outside the parenthesis. This turns the problem into a two step equation.

The second method moves the ``excess baggage'' from the side with the variable, starting with the furthest baggage away from the variable.
\begin{example}{Solve Equations Using Distribution on One Side}{}
    Solve $2(3x-5)=4$ for x
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[] Distribute the 2 into the parenthesis
        \begin{align*}
            2(3x-5)&=4&\textcolor{red}{\textrm{   Original Equation}}\\
            2\cdot 3x -2\cdot 5&=4&\textcolor{red}{\textrm{   Distributive Property}}\\
            6x-10&=4&\textcolor{red}{\textrm{   Simplify (Do the math)}}     
        \end{align*}
        \item[] Solve Using Previous Methods
        \begin{align*}        
            6x-10&=4\\
            6x&=14&\textcolor{red}{\textrm{   Addition Property of Equality (Add 10 to both sides)}}\\
            x&=\dfrac{14}{6}&\textcolor{red}{\textrm{   Division Property of Equality (Divide both sides by 6)}}\\
            x&=\dfrac{7}{3}&\textcolor{red}{\textrm{   Simplify (Do the math)}}
        \end{align*}
    \end{itemize}
\end{example}
\begin{note}{Warning - If you are not comfortable with fractions}{}
    Do \textbf{NOT} use the following method if it will result in fractions after the first step (i.e., the number in front of the parenthesis is not a factor of the number on the other side of the equals sign).
\end{note}
\begin{example}{Solve Distribution Equations WITHOUT Distributing}{}
    Solve $2(3x-5)=4$ for x
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[] Get rid of the number outside of the parenthesis
        \begin{align*}
            2(3x-5)&=4&\textcolor{red}{\textrm{   Original Equation}}\\
            (3x -5)&=2&\textcolor{red}{\textrm{   Division Property of Equality (Divide both sides by 2)}}
        \end{align*}
        \item[] Solve Using Previous Methods
        \begin{align*}              
            3x-5&=2\\
            3x&=7&\textcolor{red}{\textrm{   Addition Property of Equality (Add 5 to both sides)}}\\
            x&=\dfrac{7}{3}&\textcolor{red}{\textrm{   Division Property of Equality (Divide both sides by 3)}}
        \end{align*}
    \end{itemize}
